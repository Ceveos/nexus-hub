# Nexus Hub

Nexus Hub is a platform that allows anyone to create a free gaming-focused community website.

## Features
- Create a free custom website for your community.
- Showcase all games and servers within your community with real-time info.
- Have a one-stop shop donation store where users can purchase currency, ranks and more. These purchases can be shared between servers and games.
- Use OpenAI to monitor in-game behavior and flag inappropriate chats.
- Moderate a server right from your browser.

## Monetization
NexusHub was designed from the ground up to succeed only when your community succeeds. As such, all core features not involving AI will be forever free.

With that said, transparency is key. NexusHub plans to monetize in the following ways:

### Subscriptions
NexusHub will offer two tiers of subscriptions targeted at larger communities with more advanced needs.
  - **Tier 1** (Basic, $5/month): The entry-level subscription. This will allow a community to set up a custom domain for their page and have the ability to remove any branding from their site.
  - **Tier 2** (Advanced, $10/month): This builds on tier 1 and adds the ability to use your own OpenAI API key for features such as chat moderation.

### Marketplace 
NexusHub will eventually offer a marketplace where community owners can sell currency or other virtual items (such as ranks) for their servers. These purchases work across servers and across games.
Like all other major marketplaces, a portion of all sales will be kept for NexusHub.

> **Note**
> Marketplace is a completely optional value-add to the community and can be turned off at any time.
